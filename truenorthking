            <h4 style="border:5px solid #000000;">Obyn is a good hero because he can make you money and attacks bloons (unlike benjamin). Obyn shoots out wolf spirits to atatck The bloons.

            <h4 style="border:5px solid #000000;">Sauda is the best hero on this list because she is good for everything. She can hit Camo bloons at right away and has the fastest atatck speed ot of all the heros. She cant hit leads till level 12 but she can hi leads with her level 3 ability. she has a small range but shreads most bloons that go by her. Sauda is relly good for early game because she can solo till round 30 ish. she is good becase she is also relly powerful so she can be good for late game to. Sauda's level three ability is  Leaping Sword ability. When activated, aims at a target based on her target priority, hitting multiple bloons in a tiny area and leaving behind an "aftersword" that deals contact damage to passing bloons. Cooldown of 30 seconds. And her level ten ability is Sword Charge ability. When activated, she charges from the back of the track path towards the front, damaging any bloon type including Leads. Creates more copies of herself on maps with multiple entries or multiple exits. Deals 30 damage to up to 400 bloons on screen with each copy of herself, plus even more damage to stunned bloons. And that is why sada is the best hero in BTD 6 (in my opinon)</h4>
